ENGR 133 Program Description 
	Calculates dicriminant of a polynomial

Assignment Information
	Assignment:     Py2_ACT Task 5 Discriminant
	Author:         Zachary Williams, will2051@purdue.edu
	Team ID:        001-01 (e.g. 001-14 for section 1 team 14)
	
Contributor:    Name, login@purdue [repeat for each]
	My contributor(s) helped me:	
	[ ] understand the assignment expectations without
		telling me how they will approach it.
	[ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
		without helping me plan my solution.
	[ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
		bug present in my code without looking at my code.
	Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
	have to list that person as a contributor here as well.
