	[ ] understand the assignment expectations without
		telling me how they will approach it.
	[ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
		without helping me plan my solution.

		bug present in my code without looking at my code.
	Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
	have to list that person as a contributor here as well.
